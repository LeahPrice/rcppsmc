 * Make the data a data component of the package.
   
 * For blockpfGaussianOpt et al, we could be fancy and return an S3 object
   with a plot method.  Maybe later.

 * Add support for an arma::mat version of the particle values and allow
   for whole population move and initialization functions. This
   would be useful for the many applications for which the particle values
   can be represented by a vector of real numbers.
   
 * Add other interesting SMC algorithms, e.g.
   * The iterated auxiliary particle filter of Guarniero et al. (2015).
   * Divide-and-Conquer SMC (Lindsten et al., 2016).
   * Particle MCMC (Andrieu et al., 2010).
   
 * Add extra functionality to the history to store all particles and ancestral lines.
 
 * Add functions relevant to multidimensional linear Gaussian models, including
   a Kalman filter and a fully adapted auxiliary particle filter.
   
 * Generalize the examples.
 
 * Create vignette(s).
