 * Add more examples

 * For blockpfGaussianOpt et al, we could be fancy and return an S3 object
   with a plot method.  Maybe later.
   
 * Update all documentation

 * Add a flag so that the optional MCMC moves are only performed when resampling is performed.
 
 * Add support for an arma::mat version of the particle values.
 
 * Complete a full implementation using arma::Mat for the particle values. This will
   essentially mean that particles are restricted to be arma::Vec of a standard type. This
   implementation can be compared to less restrictive implementations and, if useful,
   support can be added using e.g. derived classes.
   
 * Add other interesting SMC algorithms, e.g.
   * The iterated auxiliary particle filter of Guarniero et al. (2015)
   * Divide-and-Conquer SMC (Lindsten et al., 2016)
   * Particle MCMC (Andrieu et al., 2010)
   
 * Add extra functionality to the history to store all particles and ancestral lines
   
 * Consider other evidence estimators (e.g. importance sampling based estimators in the
   case of independent proposals)
   
 * Specific to likelihood annealing SMC - make power posterior recycling (e.g.
   Nguyen et al. (2014)) easier to apply more generally
   
 * Consider the use of derivative information (e.g. via MALA) - though this is probably
   something to demonstrate just through an example.
