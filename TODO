 * Add more examples

 * For blockpfGaussianOpt et al, we could be fancy and return an S3 object
   with a plot method.  Maybe later.
   
 * Update all documentation

 * Add a flag so that the optional MCMC moves are only performed when resampling is performed.
 
 * Add back in support for a non-vectorised version
 
 * Complete a full implementation using arma::Mat for the particle values. This will
   essentially mean that particles are restricted to be arma::Vec of a standard type. This
   implementation can be compared to less restrictive implementations and, if useful,
   support can be added using e.g. derived classes.
   
 * Add other interesting SMC algorithms, e.g.
   * The iterated auxiliary particle filter of Guarniero et al. (2015)
   * Divide-and-Conquer SMC (Lindsten et al., 2016)
   * Particle MCMC (Andrieu et al., 2010)
   
 * Consider other evidence estimators (e.g. importance sampling based estimators in the
   case of independent proposals and path sampling based estimators when the derivative of
   the unnormalised density respect to the tempering parameter is known, for example in
   likelihood annealing SMC)
   
 * Specific to likelihood annealing SMC - add an example which uses power posterior
   recycling (e.g. Nguyen et al. (2014)).
   
 * Consider the use of derivative information (e.g. via MALA)
